# Foreign Verbs

Spaced reptition of verbs in a foreign language.

## Description

A script that sends you at specific intervals (`cron` job) the conjugation of a verb.

For example, I want to be send daily via email the conjugation of a verb in Russian (the language I am learning) in the present tense. The verb is randomly selected from a list of verbs that I have already studied. Basically, it is a form of spaced repetition.

PS: I also want to apply what I recently learned in [Version Control with Git](https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git) and start using long-term branches (`main` and `develop`) and feature branches.
